# Your Privacy on The Wasp Alloy
When it comes to **The Wasp Alloy** itself, no personal data whatsoever is collected, as none is needed for the website to run properly.
The Wasp Alloy stores a variable in your local browser to determine which articles you have read. This variable serves only to tell the server that your browser has seen an article, and by extension, not to add a number to the view count on each post. **It does NOT include any identifiable information, such as your IP address, country of residence, or any personal information, with NO exceptions.**
Think of it as a checker which asks your browser, "Hey Browser, have you seen this post before?" If the answer is no, the checker tells your browser, "Okay, you are new here, so I'm going to add 1 view to the post." If the answer is yes, the checker says, "Okay, you have seen this post, so the view count won't be changed."
