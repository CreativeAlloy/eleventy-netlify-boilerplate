**The Office, 8:33 AM:** Following an incredibly productive interview, Arabian supergenius Ahmed Ali is rejected in favor of a certified idiot, with the rationale that, "No matter how much experience and knowledge you have, what we're sniffing after is that sweet university diploma."

Because the Western World is obsessed with Arabians, this has caused major public outrage, with Western World streets being flooded by protesters shouting terrorist slogans, attacking innocent people, and vandalizing public spaces intended for peaceful activities.

> "ISLAMOPHOBIA!!!" screamed a woman with pale blue hair and a lip piercing waving what appeared to be an Arab Revolt flag, who asked to remain anonymous. "APARTHEID!!!"

The Wasp Alloy expert journalists have reached out to Ahmed Ali himself to inquire on the subject further.

> "You see," he began, "the problem is that I'm a polyglot, a spectacular creative and analytical writer, and I even have experience educating and shaping young minds. My knowledge shines with flying colors for sure, but The Office declared over a phone call that I was rejected due to lacking certifications, and instead, some bloke who passed with the lowest possible passing grade was picked for the position instead. It's an injustice."

Upon inquiry, Ahmed Ali denied that this had anything to do with his ethnicity.

> "Yeah, I've no idea what the Western World has smoked," Ahmed admitted, "but the problem here is systematic and genuinely has nothing to do with who or what I am, but rather, was I privileged enough to afford university education just for the certificates. Believe me, my best friend Avner from Israel also faced the same issue, but the rest of the world seemed rather quiet when it happened."

Despite universities' best interests, one major hurdle to achieving said best interests, is money - rather, its requirement.
