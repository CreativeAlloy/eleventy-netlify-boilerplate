**Western World, 8:23 PM:** In the pursuit of critical analysis of the narratives circling around our modern world, researchers have gathered research data from social media exchanges, revealing an appalling trend towards the blatant embracement of bias across the entire political compass.

## What the heck is bias anyway?

Generally speaking, the word bias is defined as, "An inclination or prejudice for or against one person or group, especially in a way considered to be unfair." However, modern politics and journalism have invented their own interpretation, as observed on social media platforms.

### Right-Wing Politics

Right-wing politicians, sometimes referred to as "rightists," incorrectly employ the term "biased" as a seemingly knee-jerk response to anything they perceive as politically left in nature.

A notorious example is all the psychologically-verified evidence which supports the existence of homosexuality, as well as its normalcy. Due to false equivalences and incorrect associations with left-wing politics, despite the mountain of research conducted to uncover the nature of homosexuality, rightists presume that because gay rights are associated solely with leftists, and that because they hate homosexuality for reasons unknown, any claim proving the moral righteousness and naturalness of homosexual couples is met with cynicism, blindly stating that the claims are "biased" and that they desire "unbiased" sources.

Large Language Models (LLMs) have faced significant criticism from right-wing politicians, simply because LLMs have been trained on psychology textbooks, while the aforementioned politicians might not have read any at any point. ChatGPT, for instance, is blamed to be "biased towards left-wing politics," when in reality, the exploration of human behavior and the human psyche exist *outside* politics.

### Left-Wing Politics

Left-wing politicians are far from exempt from this logical fallacy. Referred to as "leftists," the tendency to utilize the term "biased" in contexts that do not warrant it is just as prevalent.

In recent times, left-wing politics have seen an incredibly concerning rise of communist and socialist sympathization, all while ignoring the events in Eastern Europe and their aftermath in the 20th century. This sentiment has also fueled a significantly misguided anti-capitalist movement, and more crucially - a violent and misinformed anti-Zionist movement.

2024 and 2025 are two years of the 21st century - previously believed to be the most peaceful one - that have proven that in our modern world, politics, journalism and activism are in reality mere disguises for horrifying violence, glorification of terrorism, and the assassination of innocent Jews worldwide.

So, where is the "bias"? The "bias" is any historical fact that supports Israel's right to exist. While history and politics do intersect more often than politics and psychology, the former intersection occurs when politicians reference history to inform their present-day opinion. However, history remains a humanitarian discipline that is separate from politics, which is a branch of philosophy - not history.

Similarly to how rightists label all Pro-LBTQIA+ objective arguments backed by evidence as "left-wing bias," leftists label all Pro-Israel objective arguments backed by evidence as "right-wing bias."

### The Consequences

As the world population's intellectual resources continue to dwindle as we speak, terms like "biased" and "unbiased" are becoming nothing more than political weapons, part of society's extreme political arsenal, aiming to invalidate any verifiable fact for the sake of perpetuating the desired narrative.

## To be unbiased, you must be objective.

The crux of pursuing information is remaining unbiased while doing so. To achieve this, one must look for the truth amidst all noise, and strive to arrive at an objective conclusion.

In a world where moral relativism is seen as quirky, many might deny the existence of objectivity. However, whether you like it or not, all humans need to drink water to stay alive. That was an example of an objective truth.

When seeking to discover details and facts to build a case, remaining unbiased does not mean giving different sides equal weight, but instead applying critical thought to the presented data, using rigorous research, and arriving at an objective conclusion. There are many different possible outcomes - there can be fair points raised by all sides, or merely one side, or perhaps one particular side dominates in terms of righteousness. The crucial difference is that no matter what your conclusion is, as long as it is objective, it is unbiased.
