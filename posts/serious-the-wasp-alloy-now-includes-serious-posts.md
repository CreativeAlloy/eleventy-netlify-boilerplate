**The Wasp Alloy Platform, 7:19 PM:** After thinking about different ways to present serious content, I have made the decision to introduce a new type of post - Serious Post.

Until today, I've been using The Wasp Alloy to write absurdly pointed satire. Given that I want to make use of my own platform to share serious events and essays without making life more difficult with another, separate platform or other convoluted setups, I've established visual and textual cues as to which posts are my usual witty satire, and which ones are meant to be serious.

For starters, all serious articles don a blue theme. Everything that's usually colored green on TWA will be colored blue on serious articles alone.

Moreover, serious articles have both "[Serious]" in their titles, and a "serious" tag at the bottom. All articles so far have been organized into different tags or categories if you will, and under "serious" you'll be able to find all serious ones.

Lastly, all TWA posts feature a "The Wasp Alloy" italicized and emboldened signature at the bottom. For serious articles, I'll write my own name instead.

Thanks for reading!
