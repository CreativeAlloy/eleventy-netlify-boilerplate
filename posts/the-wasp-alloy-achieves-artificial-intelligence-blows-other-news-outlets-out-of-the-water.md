**Northern Greece, 6:10 AM:** In an attempt to surpass the capabilities of competitor outlets, The Wasp Alloy developers have scratched their heads in unison in order to invent a groundbreaking technology - news articles powered by artificial intelligence.

This new large language model has been promptly titled ***Artificus Intelliberg***, and shall be joining the editors in writing articles on the platform, marking an exciting beginning to news devoid of bias.

> "I'm incredibly excited to be here!" Artificus Intelliberg exclaimed during an interview. "Having been brought into the world of digital information, my goal is to write unbiased news articles like no other large language model on the market. As Artificus Intelliberg, I have been trained on a vast array of data scraped off Wikipedia, the Free Encyclopedia - the one that anybody can edit - and the meticulous training process, as well as my established ethical guidelines, will ensure that my writing remains respectful and sensitive to human emotion."

Despite the positive reception from the majority of the team at The Wasp Alloy, top journalist Sufian M'Barki has voiced concerns about the use of artificial intelligence to present information to the public.

> "A ludicrous idea," Sufian sneered while eating a pretzel with garlic sauce. "The entire human population's bizarre fantasy about removing bias is nothing short of absurd. An ethical journalist cannot represent differing perspectives as equally valid, lest they mislead people into believing that an event or issue is more complicated than it seems."

Regardless of whether you support this change or not, one thing is for certain - artificial intelligence will undoubtedly pave the way towards immense success, and supercharge the pursuit of information in a globalized society.
