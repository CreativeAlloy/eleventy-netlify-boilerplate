**The Ether, Internet, 6:00 AM:** After an incident in a public Discord server, Moderator bans victim and gives abuser a slap on the wrist, officials state.

In yet another display of terminally online delirium, abuser titled "Mr. MinecraftEmperor" launched a series of personal attacks at fellow netizens twice as young as himself, in an attempt to intimidate and cause chaos. One of those netizens was none other than our expert journalist "Sufian M′Barki", who has fallen prey to moderator misconduct performed by Discord user "Moderator".

A swarm of reporters have been able to retrieve the receipts that summarize the interaction.

> "His fee'fees got hurt. Last word freak. Degenerate. You are pretty fucked up in the head to say that cashier work is dehumanizing. LOL. What you said was pretty high on the degenerate scale. Harrassing young people? I'm not the one influencing degenerate behavior... PARTICULARLY to young people."

Those were Mr. MinecraftEmperor's words that brought very colorful decoration nobody asked for into a chatroom meant for functioning adults.

> "Holy fuck, get a grip," stated Sufian. "You are a man in your 40s harassing young people online for stating an objective truth, and you have the balls to call them degenerates who have made bad life choices? Let's see the moderator's verdict."

A few minutes later, the Arabian added:

> "It's depressing that you have no idea you have committed dozens of logical fallacies just because you have a personal vendetta against me lol. 'I think I am an arbiter of morality and sociology but actually I am behaving like a sociopath online.'"

Moderator examined the chat logs, and shared their statement with the public.

> "I don't like how the victim responded," they claimed. "Both sides used personal attacks. And I like my victims innocent and enabling of abusive behavior. I can't have a victim who talks back to a sour old sod on my server. As such, I have banned the victim. But to the man, I just gave a very stern warning while wagging my finger, ensuring that he will never act out of line again."

This aged like milk.
