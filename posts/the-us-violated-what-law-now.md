## Narco-Terrorist Dictator Maduro of Venezuela was captured by US troops, liberating the nation of Venezuela in the process.

So, Chinese people and their sympathizers are making a ruckus about it on social media - typical behavior.

> 🇨🇳🇹🇼 China wants to capture Taiwan like Venezuela and “run it” as Trump said.
>
> On Chinese social media, users believe that China should use Trump's methods towards Taiwan.
>
> This is reported by Bloomberg, citing Chinese users. The operation to capture Maduro has garnered more than 440 million views on Chinese social media.
>
> "Since the US doesn't take international law seriously, why should we care?", "I suggest using the same method to return Taiwan in the future", - write users of the Chinese social network Weibo.
>
> Other users suggest kidnapping Lai Ching-te, the President of Taiwan, as well.
>
> Bloomberg cites the opinion of analysts who believe that the operation against Venezuela could push China to take more decisive actions.
>
> "Privately, I expect Beijing to emphasize to Washington that it expects to be granted the same privileges regarding exceptions to international law that the US grants itself", - believes Ryan Hass, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and a former American diplomat.
>
> It should be noted that China does not consider its possible actions towards Taiwan to be a violation of international law, as it perceives this island as part of its internationally recognized territory.
>
> Taiwan, as an independent state separate from the PRC, is recognized by only 12 small countries. The US, Ukraine, Russia, and EU countries do not recognize Taiwan's independence.

Oh - the US *violated* an international law by capturing a terrorist criminal who posed a direct threat to the United States, a sovereign state with the right to protect itself?

That's funny. They like to cry bloody murder over this shiny concept they call "International Law" because it's the aesthetic they care about - the *concept* of violating it that fuels their desire to trash the US right now. But have they sat down to think about whether it's true?

An International Law was violated? Which one? And more importantly, who is this omnipresent authority who actually has any say over the US? Is the US not the literal creator of NATO where **they** define the international laws member states must follow?

China's invasion of Taiwan **will** be a violation of international law, because they are attacking a sovereign state that **they** have been oppressing for a long time, and to which **they** pose a threat. So for all intents and purposes, if they state anything under the guise of "sovereign interests" - it is void when the outcome isn't the ethical, logical, or even legally correct thing to do. More importantly, it's completely void if the outcome **won't** be citizens screaming with joy after having their dictator taken away.

US Action: Removed a Narco-Terrorist Dictator who was actively destabilizing the region, starving his people, and posing a direct threat to the US in being an ally of Iran, Russia, China, and North Korea. Outcome: Joy.
Chinese Threat: Invading a functional democracy (Taiwan) to impose totalitarian control, because of a false equivalence. Outcome: Subjugation.

Simplified, it's okay to capture a terrorist especially if you have a good reason to do so, but it's not okay for a terrorist (China) to invade a territory it wants for itself and subjucate the people.

So, these Chinese know-it-alls are missing the nuance - a sign of their lack of intellectual rigor, and of how unacquainted they are with the abstract "International Laws" they love to throw around for rhetorical purposes only. 🙂

Let's get a few things straight. Sovereignty isn't promised to every nation regardless of what it does. If a state fails to protect its own people - or even worse, terrorizes them, and poses a threat to other states in the region, maybe even the entire world - then under this same "International Law," this state **voids** its sovereignty.

In this case, intervention is a restoration of order. And that intervention was incredibly timely, provided that Persians are revolting and fighting to liberate their own state from the Islamic Regime (Mullahs).
